# Model Network that Computes whether a digit is an 8 digit number or not
# Input 16x16 region image Output: Confidence Score: How confident the network is in the number being classified as an 8


# Problem Taxonomy - Decision Problem.
# "Procedure" / Framework -> factor 1: is there a loop? factor 2: are there 2 loops?
# Why is it reasonable to even have a weights and bias framework?

# Layer 1 - Starting from Complete Scratch, why is it intuitively reasonable to arrive at a layered neural network model with weights?
# Why use biases, factors, weights, and activation functions? 

## Question 1 - If I wanted to create a model that classified if a number was an 8, how would I go about that?
## - I am building this "thing" that does some sort of task. 

## - need for subproblems / subcomponents as a way for simplifying a task. 

    # Ideas and inherent complexities that come with the problem + knowledge on smaller components and observations used to decide.
    #     --> Why are "factors" important?: difficulty to observe a solution at its whole, only hope is to divide it into manageable subproblems, 
    # that one can solve. (I think about inputs, as really just being solved problems because one observes it already, and now has to be built into a more complex solution)
    # things that one must consider.

## "Emphasis" on Certain Factors Motivation for prioritizing certain features/factors for solving a problem.



## Given that I learn from a specific piece of data and that there is a huge cost, how do I change my weights based on the information I obtain? (realize how significant cost changes is equivalent to thinking in hindsight how i could have thought differently which would allow a major change in the abstracted factor)


# Layer 2 - Given that I have a neural network model, and that I am on this abstracted layer, what problems may arise in learning?
