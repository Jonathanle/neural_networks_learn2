For the first exercise, I want to have the task of classifying things into certain categories based on the non-linear dataset, 
I will use a multilayer perceptron network in order to train this network for activation.


- I will learn more rigorously why every component of a multilayer pereptron network is used in order to solve a task.


- How can I build a classifier that recognizes digits?

 - Do not manually directly tell the classifier how to behave for the parameters
 - Use neural-network
- Can I build a classifier that recognizes the digit 8?


- End Goal - Classifier



1. Framework 1 - Learning and Classification as Factor Exercise
Weigh on Certain Factors (With no Bias) --> sum
- With no bias, assign a bias to each function


Keywords 
- Activation Function --> encoding belief creating an interface of belief in a certain factor.
- Bias - 



AIM 
- When it 

- Finding composite features.
